## Requirements
- Java 14
- Bungeecord 1.16-R0.2
- MySQL-Database

## How to set up
First of all, you have to change the repository.yml, in which you can change the database settings.
Afterwise, it should all be set up and ready to use.
If you want to, you can also change the messages send by the plugin in the messages.yml.

## How to use
In the beginning, the staff can perform the command `/support login`, which automatically opens the queue.
The players in need of support can use `/support ` to join it.
The supporter can use `/support next` which opens a new ticket.
As soon as the problem is solved, the ticket can be closed with `/support finish`.
Furthermore, you have the possibility to ban players from to support with `/support punish`. The duration of the bans can be edited in the punishSteps.yml.

## The reason for that plugin
As I wondered what project next to upload, a friend told me he had an old concept, I could implement.
